I am building a small tool to recreate analysis of outlier suspiscious transactions

This is intended to show compliance students how to detect aniomalies an d suspiscious transactions or movements.

Use python for everything.

- Use faker to generate fake data
- Use pandas to analyze the data
- Use seaborn to visualize the data
- Use scikit-learn to detect anomalies
- Use scikit-learn to detect suspiscious transactions
- Use scikit-learn to detect outliers
- Data must be created in a csv file
- Use chilean spanish for the data
- Use a simple UI to show the data
- Use isolation forest to detect anomalies


My use case is that i am going to load an excel file with the data and then i will be able to see the data in the UI.

Give me the full architecture:
 - File + folder structure
 - What each part does
 - Where state lives, how services connect
